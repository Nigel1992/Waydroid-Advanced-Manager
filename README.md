## 📝 Logging

Logs are written to:

```
~/.cache/waydroid-manager/waydroid-manager.log

```

Install and uninstall actions are logged separately (per-APK results and batch summaries). Log files are rotated when they exceed 1 MB.

## 📋 Copy/Paste to Android (Option 9) — Important Notes

- Usage: focus the input field inside Android, select Option 9, type or paste text into your terminal and press ENTER. The script automatically sends the text to the currently active input box in Android.
- Supported: All plain text including special characters (e.g. `& | ; < > $ \` `). Newlines are not yet supported (single-line only).
- Safety: The tool only accepts plain text — files or binary data are not supported.
